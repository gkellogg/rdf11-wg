    <h2>Overview of RDF/JSON</h2>

    <p>An RDF Graph consists of a set of RDF triples, each triple consisting
    of a subject, a predicate and an object (formally defined in [[!RDF11-CONCEPTS]]).
    An RDF/JSON document serializes such a set of RDF triples as a series of nested 
    data structures. </p>

    <p>A conforming RDF/JSON document consists of a single JSON object called
    the root object. Each unique subject in the set of triples is represented as a key
    in the root object. No key may appear more than once in the root object.</p>
    
    <p>The value of each root object key is a further JSON object whose 
    keys are the URIs of the predicates occuring in triples with the
    given subject. These keys are known as predicate keys. 
    No predicate key may appear more than once within a single object.</p>
    
    <p>The value of each predicate key is an array of JSON objects representing 
    the object of each serialized triple.</p>
    
    

    <p>In general, a triple (subject S, predicate P, object O) is 
    serialized in the following structure:</p>

    <pre>{ "S" : { "P" : [ O ] } }</pre>

    <p>The object of the triple O is represented as a further JSON 
    object with the following keys:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>type</dt>
      <dd>one of 'uri', 'literal' or 'bnode' (required)</dd>
      <dt>value</dt>
      <dd>the URI of the object, its lexical value or a blank node label depending on whether the object is a uri, literal or bnode
      </dd>
      <dt>lang</dt>
      <dd>the language of a literal value (optional but if supplied it must not be empty)</dd>
      <dt>datatype</dt>
      <dd>the datatype URI of the literal value (optional)</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Blank node subjects are named using a string conforming to the nodeID production in Turtle. For example: _:A1</p>

    <p>The 'lang' and 'datatype' keys should only be used if the value of the 'type' key is "literal".</p>

    <p>All keywords defined in this document are case sensitive, and
    must be lowercase.</p>

    <h2>Serialization of RDF as JSON</h2>
    <p>Given a set of RDF Triples an RDF/JSON document may be constructed using the following algorithm:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start a JSON object (called the root object)</li>
      <li>Group all the triples by subject</li>
      <li>For each unique subject:
          <ol>
          <li>Create a JSON object for the subject (called the subject object)</li>
          <li>Group all triples having the current subject by predicate</li>
          <li>For each unique predicate:
              <ol>
              <li>Create a JSON array (called the value array)</li>
              <li>Select all triples having the current subject and current predicate</li>
              <li>For each triple:
                <ol>
                  <li>Create a JSON object (called the value object)</li>
                  <li>Add the following key/value pairs to the value object:
                    <ul>
                      <li>If the object of the triple is an RDF URI Reference 
                      U add a key called "type" with a value being the string "uri". Add a key
                      called "value" with the value being U.</li>
                      <li>If the object of the triple is an RDF Literal S
                      add a key called "type" with a value being the string "literal". Add a key
                      called "value" with the value being the lexical form of S and:
			<ul><li>If the object of the triple is an RDF Literal with language L, add a key called "lang" with the 
                      value being L.</li>
                            <li>If the object of the triple is an RDF Typed Literal with datatype URI D, add a key called "datatype" with the 
                      value being D.</li>
			</ul>
                      <li>If the object of the triple is a Blank Node with label I
                      add a key called "type" with a value being the string "bnode". Add a key
                      called "value" with the value being the string formed by concatenting an underscore (U+005F) followed by a colon (U+003A) followed by I.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Push the value object onto the end of the value array.</li>
                </ol>
              <li>Add a key/value pair to the subject object with the key being the predicate URI and the value being the value array.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Add a key/value pair to the root object with value being the subject object created in the previous step and the key being one of the following:
            <ul>
              <li>If the subject of the triple is an RDF URI Reference U the key is  U.</li>
              <li>If the subject of the triple is a Blank Node with label I
              the key is the string formed by concatenting an underscore (U+005F) followed by a colon (U+003A) followed by I.</li>
