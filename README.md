### Mercurial 101

For those who have not used mercurial before, here is how to start:

    # To start:
    # Create on your own filespace a directory for mercurial
    cd mercurial-directory
    # Create a clone of the repository
    hg clone https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/rdf/

    # From that point on:
    # Edit a file
    cd rdf
    edit Any-file-in the-directory-tree

    # Commit the change to your local clone
    hg commit -m 'Some comments on what you did and why'

    # Push all your local changes to the public repository
    cd rdf
    hg push
    # (If you get the error "did you forget to merge? use push -f to force"
    # then you'll need to do a merge.  DO NOT use push -f.)

    # To receive changes made by others into your local repository:
    cd rdf
    hg pull
    hg update 

    # the two previous steps can be in one:
    hg pull -u
