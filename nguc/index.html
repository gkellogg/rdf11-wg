    <h2>Editor's Draft Status</h2>
    
    <p>This text came from <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/rdf/raw-file/d1c5a569d603/rdf-spaces/index.html#">RDF Spaces and Datasets (15 May 2012)</a>, and now is being updated here.</p>

<section class="informative">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>


    <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">Resource
    Description Framework (RDF)</a> provides a simple declarative way
    to store and transmit information.  It also provides a trivial but
    effective way to combine information from multiple sources, with
    graph merging.  This allows information from different people,
    different organizations, different units within an organization,
    different servers, different algorithms, etc, to all be combined
    and used together, without any special processing or understanding
    of the relationships among the providers.</p>

    <p>For some applications, the basic RDF merge operation is overly
    simplistic, as extra processing and an understanding of the
    relationships among the providers may be useful.  This document
    enumerates some of these applicatsion.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use Cases</h2>

  <p>Each of these use cases is initally described in terms of the
  following scenario.  Details of how each use case might be addressed
  are in <a href="#detailed-example" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

  <blockquote style="font-style: italic">

    <p>The Example Foundation is a large organization with more than
    ten thousand employees and volunteers, spread out over five
    continents.  It has branches in <b>25 different countries</b>, and
    those divisions have considerable autonomy; they are only loosely
    controlled by the parent organization (called "headquarters" or
    "HQ") in Geneva.</p>

    <p>HQ wants to help the divisions work together better.  It
    decides a first step is to provide a simple but complete directory
    of all the Example personnel.  Until now, each division has
    maintained its own directory, using its own technology.  HQ wants to gather them all together, building a <b>federated phonebook</b>.  They want
    to be able to find someone's phone number, mailing address,
    and job title, knowing only their name or email addresses.  Later,
    they hope to extend the system to allow finding people based on
    their areas of interest and expertise.</p>

    <p>HQ understands that people will want access to the phonebook in
    many different computing environments and with different
    languages, social norms, and application styles.  Users are going
    to want at least one Web based user interface (UI), but they will
    also want mobile UIs for different platforms, desktop UIs for
    different platforms, and even to look up information via text
    messaging.  HQ does not have the resources to build all of these,
    so they intend to provide <b>direct access to the data</b> so that the
    divisions can do it themselves as needed.</p>

  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The first section below describes a minimal, baseline approach.
  Each section after that describes a new system requirement, a new
  thing the users in this scenario want the federated phonebook to
  do.</p>

  <section id="uc-start">
    <h2>Baseline Solution (Just Triples)</h2>

    <blockquote style="font-style: italic">

      <p>As a starting point, HQ needs to gather data from each
      division and re-publish it, in one place, for use by the
      different UIs.</p>

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This is a general use case for RDF, with no specific need for
    using named graphs.  It simply involves
    divisions publishing RDF data on the web (with some common
    vocabulary and with access control), then HQ merging it and
    putting it on their website (with access control).</p>

    <p>For an example of how this baseline could be implemented, see
    <a href="#example-start" class="sectionRef"></a></p>

  </section>

  <section id="uc-web">
    <h2>Showing Provenance</h2>

    <blockquote style="font-style: italic">

      <p>A user says: I'm looking at an incorrect phonebook entry.  It
      has the name of the person I'm looking for, but it's missing
      most of the record.  I can't even tell which division the person
      works for.  I need to know who is responsible for this
      information, so I can get it corrected.
      </p>

      <p>While this might be address by including a "report-errors-to"
      field in each phonebook entry, HQ is looking ahead to the day
      when other information is in the phonebook &mdash; like which
      projects the person has worked on &mdash; which might be come
      from a variety of others sources, possibly other divisions.</p>

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>For a discussion of how this use case could be addressed, see
    <a href="#example-web" class="sectionRef"></a></p>

  </section>

  <section id="uc-process">
    <h2>Maintaining Derived Data</h2>

    <blockquote style="font-style: italic">

      <p>It turns out different divisions are using somewhat different
      vocabularies for publishing their data.  HQ writes a program to
      translate, but they need the output of that program to be
      correctly attributed, in case it turns out to be wrong.
      </p>

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This use case motivates sharing of blank nodes between named
    graphs, as seen in the example.</p>

    <p>For a discussion of how this use case could be addressed, see
    <a href="#example-process" class="sectionRef"></a></p>

  </section>


  <section id="uc-reported">
    <h2>Distributed Harvesting</h2>

    <blockquote style="font-style: italic">

      <p>It turns out some divisions do not have centralized
      phonebooks.  Division 3 has twelve different departments, each
      with its own phonebook.  Divsion 3 can do the harvesting from
      its departments, but it does not want to be in the loop for
      corrections; it wants those to go straight back to the relevant
      department.
      </p>

    <a href="#example-reported" class="sectionRef"></a></p>

  <section id="uc-untrusted">
    <h2>Loading Untrusted Datasets</h2>

    <blockquote style="font-style: italic">

      <p>A user reports: There's information here that says it's from
      our department, but it's not.  Somehow your provenance
      information is wrong.  We need to see the provenance of the
      provenance!</p>

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>For a discussion of how this use case could be addressed, see
    <a href="#example-untrusted" class="sectionRef"></a></p>

  </section>


  <section id="uc-transtime">
    <h2>Showing Revision History</h2>

    <blockquote style="font-style: italic">

      <p>Division 14's legal department says: "We're doing an
      investigation and we need to be able to connect people's names
      and phone numbers as they used to be.  Can you include archival
      data in the data feed, so we we can search the phonebook as it
      was on each day of September, last year?"
      </p>

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>For a discussion of how this use case could be addressed, see
    <a href="#example-transtime" class="sectionRef"></a></p>

  </section>


  <section id="uc-validtime">
    <h2>Expressing Past or Future States</h2>

    <blockquote style="font-style: italic">

      <p>Division 5 says: "We're planning a major move in three
      months, to a neighboring city.  Everybody's office and phone
      number will have to change.  Can we start putting that
      information in the phonebook now, but mark it as not effective
      until 20 July?  After the move, we'll also need to see the old
      (no-longer-in-effect) data for a while, until we get everything
      straightened out.</p>

    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This use case, contrasted with the previous one, shows the
    difference between <em>Transaction Time</em> and <em>Valid
    Time</em> in bitemporal databases.  After Division 5's move, the
    "old" phone numbers are not just the old state of the database;
    they reflect the old state of the world.  It is possible that some
    time after the move, an error in the pre-move data might need to
    be corrected.  This would require a new transaction time, even
    though the valid-time has already ended.</p>

    <h2>Showing Change History (v6)</h2>

    <p>To keep versions, as required by <a href="#uc-transtime"
    class="sectionRef"></a>, we simply copy the old data into a new

    <p>In this example, we handle this by defining the following vocabulary:</p>

    <div class="exvoc">

      @@@ tdb   can we define each property separately with any sense, or just the block, together?

    </div>
      
    <p>If Marvin changes, rather absurdly, changes his email address

@prefix hq: &lt;http://example.org/ns/phonebook>.
@prefix v:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#>.
@prefix : &lt;>.

:g32201 {  
   #... various data, then:
   [] a v:VCard
      v:fn "Marvin Mover" ;
      v:email "marvin-0101@example.org". 
   #... more data from other people
}
[] a transt:Snapshot;
   transt:source &lt;http://div14.example.org/phonefeed>;
   transt:result :g32201;

   transt:ends "2012-01-02T00:00:00"^^xs:dateTime.

:g32202 {  
   #... various data, then:

   #... more data from other people
}

</pre>

<p>@@@ or should we put the data directly into a genid graph, so that
metadata about it is less likely to change or be wrong...?  On the other hand, there's ALSO some nice potential for metadata about the feed space.</p>

  </section>



  <section id="example-validtime">
    <h2>Showing Past and Future States (v7)</h2>


    <p>The challenge expressed in <a href="#uc-validtime"
    class="sectionRef"></a> is to segregate some of the triples,
    marking them as being in-effect only at certain times.  The study
    of how to do this is part of the field of temporal databases.</p>

    <p>In this example, we handle this by defining the following vocabulary:</p>

    <div class="exvoc">
      
      <p>This "valid-time" vocabulary allows a data publisher to
      express a time range during which the triples in some space are
      considered valid.  This acts like a time-dependent version of
      owl:import, where the import is only made during the given time
      range.</p>

      <dl>
	<dt><span class="schema">(rdf:space Sp)</span> vt:starts <span class="schema">(xs:dateTime T1)</span></dt>
	<dd>Claims that all the triples in Sp are valid starting at T1, ending at some unspecified period of time.</dd>
	<dt><span class="schema">(rdf:space Sp)</span> vt:end <span class="schema">(xs:dateTime T2)</span></dt>
	<dd>Claims that all the triples in Sp are valid until just before T2, starting at some unspecified time.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>In general, these two predicates need to be used together,
      providing both vt:starts and vt:ends values for a space.  In
      this case, { ?sp vt:starts ?t1; vt:ends ?t2 } claims that all
      the triples in ?sp are in effect for all points in time t such
      that t1 &lt;= t &lt; t2.  A consumer who only knows one of the
      two times is unable to make use of data; there are no
      default values.</p>

      <p>These predicates say nothing about the validity (or "truth") of
      the triples in Sp outside of the valid-time range.  Each of the
      triples might or might not hold outside of the range &mdash;
      these vt triples simply make no claim about them.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Given this definition, it is almost trivial for Division 5 to share their "before" and "after phonebooks:</p>

    <pre class="example">@prefix vt: &lt;http://example.org/ns/valid-time>.
@prefix hq: &lt;http://example.org/ns/phonebook>.
@prefix : &lt;>.

:pre-move {  
    # all the pre-move data  
    ...
}
:post-move {
    # all the post-move data  
    ...
}

:pre-move  vt:starts "2010-01-01T00:00:00"^^xs:dateTime;
           vt:ends   "2012-07-12T00:00:00"^^xs:dateTime.
:post-move vt:starts "2012-07-12T00:00:00"^^xs:dateTime;
           vt:ends   "2020-01-01T00:00:00"^^xs:dateTime.

</pre>

     <p>This design requires every client to be modified to understand
     and use the valid-time vocabulary.  There may be designs that do
     not require this.</p>
